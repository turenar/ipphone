This application does not depend on ffmpeg x11grab,
  which is licensed under GPL v2+. This application executes x11grab
  as ffmpeg command and uses his output. This means this application
  isn't forced to be licensed under GPL v2+.
  (see: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatCaseIsOutputGPL)
  If you think this paragraph is wrong, please contact to me
  as soon as possible.
  note: This application execute ffmpeg command not to avoid
        being 'polluted by GPL', but I tried to avoid
        using ffmpeg as library because the world of ffmpeg is too big
        (and some reasons).

Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other
files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to
FFmpeg.

Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of
these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to
configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.
